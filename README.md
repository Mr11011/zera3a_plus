Zera3a+ Farm Management App
Overview
Zera3a+ is a cross-platform mobile application developed using Flutter to streamline farm operations for owners and supervisors, including inefficient resource tracking, outdated performance insights, and disorganized plot data, replacing manual record-keeping with a centralized, secure platform.
Purpose
The app enhances operational efficiency by providing farm managers with tools to organize plots, track daily activities, and gain actionable insights. It tackles issues like delayed decision-making and oversight of high-cost areas, empowering users with real-time data and intuitive features tailored to agricultural needs.
Key Features

Secure Authentication and Accessibility: Offers a secure sign-up/sign-in system with role-based access (e.g., owner, supervisor) and email verification, managed via the BLoC pattern. Features a responsive Arabic RTL UI and ensuring accessibility across devices.
Plot and Activity Management: Allows creation, editing, and deletion of farm plots with customizable attributes (e.g., name, crop type, size). Supports detailed activity tracking, enabling users to log tasks like irrigation schedules with water usage, labor hours with cost allocation, and inventory management with stock levels, all linked to specific plots for real-time, accurate records.
Insights and Reporting: Provides comprehensive reports on farm performance, including cost breakdowns (labor, irrigation, inventory), resource usage trends, and threshold-based alerts for high-cost plots. Visualized with fl_chartâ€™s interactive pie and bar charts, these insights enable data-driven decisions to optimize resources and profitability.
